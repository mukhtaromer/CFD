# CFD and Numerical Methods

This repository contains **OpenFOAM simulation cases** and a few **numerical-method scripts/notebooks**.  
The file **`OpenFoamcases.pdf`** contains the simulation results for the three OpenFOAM cases:

- **Cavity** (lid-driven cavity flow)
- **Cylinder** (flow around a cylinder)
- **airFoil2D** (2D airfoil flow)

The corresponding OpenFOAM case directories are: `Cavity/`, `Cylinder/`, and `airFoil2D/`.
The source code for the results in Heat_eq_1D.pdf are fin_solver.py and fin_error_study.py.
